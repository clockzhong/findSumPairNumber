# findSumPairNumber
Find 2 numbers in an unsorted array equal to a given sum

It's said that this is a classical interview problem, and fortunately or unfortunately, I encountered it today also.
The final target on this task is decreasing the calculation complexity from O(n*n) to O(n). I failed during the interview process to get this final target, but partly succeeded to get it after interview. The complexity could be O(n+m) now. And the memory space consumption is also O(n+m). The "m" is the value of sum we need equal. I searched in google, and found there is no similar fast solution in internet yet. I suspect this is the best way(lowest cost) so far.

One more thing, this algrithm could only deal with positive number and 0. If negtive number involved in this problem, this algrithm couldn't work correctly.
